# Memory-Game

***Sweet Memory Game***



I chose to do the memory game, because it's something that I've personally enjoyed playing. 

The theme of the game is dessert related with a set of *12 cards* and *6 matches*. 

## Getting Started

link:

The games intent is that the user has a time limit to flip all the cards. When there isn't a match, the cards will unflip and the matched sets will stay flipped. For every match, the match content will update. When the person gets all the matches a message will display saying that they won. To start the game over, the player will hit restart and the cards will shuffle and the timer will start up again as soon as a card is flipped.
